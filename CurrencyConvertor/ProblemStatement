Project:
Title: Currency Converter
Total marks: 15
Duration: 4 Days
Submission: Git
Submission deadline: 2023-01-09 7:00 PM 

Details: 
Currency conversion is expected for some currencies (USD, GBP, INR, EUR, CHF, AUD, SGD, CNY, JPY) for one given date (date 2023-01-06).

>> The conversion rates should be consumed from a text file
One possibility, your text file could look like

GBP = 1.19 USD
GBP = 98.40 INR
GBP = 1.13 EUR
GBP = 1.12 CHF

It should be a command line program that displays the following

Welcome to CCTech Currency converter:

Select the input currency from the list
1. USD
2. GBP
3. INR
4. EUR
> 1

Select the output currency from the list (should not print the selected input currency at the output)

1. GBP
2. INR
3. EUR
> 1

Please enter the amount
> 500

500 USD would be 439.46 GBP on 2023-01-06

Do you wish to continue with another conversion (Y/N)

 

Error handling should be considered for the following scenarios with given messages :

>> Input / Output currency user input is not a number

->>Adding a new currency should involve minimum changes

Test cases: 
Conversion and failure scenarios would be tested.

Grading:

If the automated tests are written by us pass (4 marks)
Coverage of tests that they have written (which means that they have to write tests) (2 marks)
Clean code practices followed (like naming, size, small functions etc.) (4 marks)
Scalability (ease of adding new currencies) (5 marks)

A		: Above 13 marks
B		: 10 to 13 marks
C		: 7 to 10 marks
Fail		: Below 7 marks

Fail action: Redo the project and implement the given feedback
